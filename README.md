# __About the Programming Assignment__

This assignment aims to hone our programming skills in basic coding in Python. This task requires us to create user-defined functions and apply them to different problems. 

1. __ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM: Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order.__

__Description__: This problem shows the use of a user-defined function and the code __.append()__ and __.sort().__ With the use of the code __word = []__ as a list, each element was separated using the code __for x in string__, inserted using __.append()__, sorted using __.sort().__, and  was joined together by the code __' '.join()__, which made the letters alphabetically arranged.

__Example:__
```
Input: Hello
Output: ehllo
```
2. __EMOTICON PROBLEM: Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad, and mad with their corresponding emoticon:__

__Description__: This problem also shows the use of a user-defined function. The code displays the use of a dictionary __emojis = {"Smile" : ":)", "Grin": ":D", "Sad": ":((", "Mad" : ">:("}__ to store data in pairs. With the use of __.split()__ to split each word in the phrase and was stored in words, then an  if-else loop to sort statements in the phrase that fit the condition, and lastly 
__' '.join__ was used to combine the designated output.

__Example:__
```
Input: I am Sad
Output: I am :(
```

3. __UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM: Unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then print all three variables.__

__Description__: This problem shows the use of a list. The code used was .split() in order to separate each number, and .sort () to arrange them. Then, the output was arranged by first, middle, and last. 

__Example:__
```
Input: 2,1,3,5,4,2
Output: First: 1, Middle: ['2', '2' ,'3' ,'4'], Last: 5
```
__Lessons Learned__:

This programming assignment taught me basic coding in Python. It taught me to make use of different predefined data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, and input, and create user-defined functions to apply to diverse problems.

__Tech(s) Used__: Jupyter Notebook
